/// Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although with some differences.
/// 
/// A typeâ€™s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type.
/// Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types.
/// Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.
